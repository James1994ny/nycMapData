NYC data maps

NYC data maps is a website I created that holds information derived from NYC datasets.
Note:I have uploaded the datasets to github location public/geojsonFiles. I have uploaded the geojson dataset files to github and utilized github's raw geojson https url to re-reference the dataset.

My application uses Node.js, Javascript, Mapbox's API , EJS/Express, Heroku.
