NYC data maps

NYC data maps is a website that holds information derived from large datasets.
Utilized mapbox and open NYC geojson datasets to highlight data.
I have uploaded the datasets public/geojsonFiles, uploaded thoes files to github and utilized github's https url to reference in my dataset.

My application uses Node.js, Javascript, Mapbox's API , EJS/Express, Heroku.
